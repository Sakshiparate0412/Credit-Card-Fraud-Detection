# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, helping financial institutions minimize financial losses.

Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, special attention is given to handling class imbalance and optimizing evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy.
